	This is just a page for learning to set up github pages. 
	it containg a simple html doc i will adjust over time to be more advanced and complete, the current page
	has a small first draft of a resume as well as fuctioning embedded code:
	
	Jupiter terminal Widget: 
	src='https://terminal.jup.ag/main-v2.js'
	
	Trading View Widget:
	class="tradingview-widget-copyright"
	src="https://www.tradingview.com"
	src="https://s3.tradingview.com/external-embedding/embed-widget-symbol-overview.js"
	
	This page is not a full or complete version and may be subject to incompletion as it is merely for me the creator 
	to learn "GitHub Pages" and may potentially be used to teach computer science student aswell.
